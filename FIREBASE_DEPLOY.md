# Firebase Deployment Guide for Coconet

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Firebase account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Install Firebase CLI
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
```
Enter your password when prompted.

## Step 2: Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window for you to authenticate with your Google account.

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase Project
```bash
cd /home/shabeer/Desktop/coconetdm
firebase init hosting
```

When prompted:
- **Select "Use an existing project" or "Create a new project"**
- **What do you want to use as your public directory?** Enter: `dist`
- **Configure as a single-page app?** Enter: `Yes`
- **Set up automatic builds with GitHub?** Enter: `No`
- **Overwrite dist/index.html?** Enter: `No`

## Step 4: Build Your Project
```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 5: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy
```

After deployment, Firebase will provide you with a URL like:
`https://your-project-name.web.app`

## Quick Deploy Script
For future deployments, just run:
```bash
npm run build && firebase deploy
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you get permission errors, use `sudo` before the command
- Make sure you're in the project directory: `/home/shabeer/Desktop/coconetdm`
- Ensure the `dist` folder exists before deploying (run `npm run build` first)

## Project Structure
- `dist/` - Production build (generated by `npm run build`)
- `firebase.json` - Firebase configuration
- `src/` - Source code

Your website is now ready to deploy! 🚀
